and do $x = \\frac{(x - u)}{s}$.\n","\n","- Binarize categorical/discrete features: For all categorical features, represent them as multiple boolean features. For example, instead of having one feature called marriage_status, have 3 boolean features - married_status_single, married_status_married, married_status_divorced and appropriately set these features to 1 or -1. As you can see, for every categorical feature, you are adding k binary feature where k is the number of values that the categorical feature
