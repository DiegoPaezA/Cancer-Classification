If only men records are removed the attribute will have only one value (Women).\n","\n","    2. **Standardize all continuous variables**: The continuous variables are standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n","\n","    3. **Categorical attributes with int values**: The categorical attributes with int values stay as they are.\n","\n","    4. **Correlation between attributes**: Winter Hypoxia Score and Ragnum Hypoxia Score are highly correlated with Buffa Hypoxia Score are (0.84 and 0.72). The attribute Buffa Hypoxia Score is removed from the dataset.\n","\n","    5. **Target Class**: The target class is unbalanced and has 3 classes related to the recurrence of breast cancer. Where class 3 is related to the absence of recurrence and classes 1 and 2 are related to the time when the recurrence occurred. In this stage no action is taken to balance the target class.\n","\n","2. **Experiments**: Four experiments (E-1 to E-4) were defined to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models in breast cancer recurrence classification.\n","\n","    1. **E-1**: Training of Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k nearest neighbors (KNN) and XGBoots (XGB) models using the original dataset with the target class grouped in three classes ( 0 = Early recurrence, 1 = Mid/Late recurrence and 3 = No recurrence). The target class is unbalanced and has 4 classes related to the recurrence of breast cancer. Where class 3 is related to the absence of recurrence and classes 0, 1 and 2 are related to the time when the recurrence occurred. Class 0 is related to an early recurrence, class 1 is related to an intermediate recurrence and class 2 is related to a late recurrence. The analysis of the target class shows that the classes 0, 1 and 2 can be grouped in two classes using k-means clustering. The classes 0, 1 and 2 are grouped in class 0 early recurrence and class 1 mid/late recurrence.\n","\n","    2. **E-2 (E-1 + GPP)**: Training of Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k nearest neighbors (KNN) and XGBoots (XGB) models using the dataset with GPP.\n","\n","    3. **E-3 (E-2 + Feature Selection)**: A feature selection techniques (mRMR) is applied to the dataset with GPP to select the most significant attributes for the target class. Then, the training of Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k nearest neighbors (KNN) and XGBoots (XGB) models is performed.\n","\n","    4. **E-4 (E-3 + Oversample)**: The technique SMOTE is applied to the dataset with GPP + Feature Selection to balance the target class.
